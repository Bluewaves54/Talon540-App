# Talon540 App
# What is it?
The Talon540 app is a culmination of different tools used to make the life of Talon members and admins easier.

# **The Features**
- Tap and Sign in:
  With the press of your phone to a sticker, Talon members can sign in and out meetings without having to worry about wasting time on annoying QR codes or sign in sheets. Users will be notified by either a vibration or a notification (user's choice) within seconds of sign-in.
 - Subgroup Chat: 
  Dont know what you are doing in Electrical today? Lost your mind in strategy? Use subgroup chats to avoid discord and other messaging platforms hassles and focus on what needs to be done.
- One stop for all things Talon: 
  Head to all Talon places such as the Discord Server, YouTube, Website, or Twitch all from within the app at the press of a button.
- More to come...
